### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Software_Insight

# Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/software_insight

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (optional)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

Create `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if running locally)
mongod

# Seed the database with comprehensive roadmaps
cd backend
npm run seed:full
```

This will create:
